# OperatingSystems
An old set of algorithms for a course called Operating Systems.

It includes:
* Disk scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, EDF)
* Frame allocation algorithms (equal, proportional, random, working set)
* Page replacement algorithms (FIFO, OPT, LRU, ALRU, RAND)

All done using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript with additional use of [Chartist](https://github.com/gionkunz/chartist-js).
